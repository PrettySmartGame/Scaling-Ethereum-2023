ETH Global Scaling Ethereum 2023
# Wally-Wallet 	🤖
### Scalling Ethereum hackathon 2023 ✨ 
Full Stack Blockchain Development 

<p>Wally Wallet is an educational game designed for families and young children to learn about web3 through play. It follows a simple flow so even the younger users can participate and have a seamless experience with web3 infrastructures. 

Our dApp covers the 4 following concepts of web3 : </p>
* Identity
* Security
* Claims your token
* Transfer your token

# How it's made 🛠:
The front end is built using ReactJs/typescript and NextJS.We used Wagmi and Ether.js for web3 integration. This allowed us to interact with our deployed smart contract from our front-end using Wagmi React Hooks.

🎨 We used Chakra UI as the main UI library for a consistent feeling . We overrided some theme with CSS files when needed. We used React audio player for the audio integration.

🌈 Rainbow Kit is used for the wallet integration. 

Use IPFS to store images to store images & user data to keep the game as decentralised as possible.

The smart contracts are deployed on Polygon Mumbai Testnet
The smart contract stores holds the following functions : Ex - make transactions etc... [ guys you need to fill up here what kind of functions the smart contract have ].

#### What we learned / the challenges we faced to scale on ethereum: 
* Create, compile & deploy a smart contract to all the L2 listed below👇 .
* Create, compile and deploy a Subgraph to The Graph's Hosted Service.
* Query your Subgraph from your front-end using GraphQL to display blockchain & ipfs data.
* Learned how to translate Web3 requierements into a web2 UI "feels like" so all users can have a great learning experience.
